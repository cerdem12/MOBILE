# MOBILE
Multi-Omics Binary Integration via Lasso Ensembles (MOBILE)

MOBILE is XXX. More info can be found [here](https://www.birtwistlelab.com/).

## Dependencies

- MATLAB
- RStudio - R
- [glmnet package](https://hastie.su.domains/glmnet_matlab/download.html)

## Instructions

1. Clone this repository from the command-line using `git clone --recursive https://github.com/cerdem12/MOBILE.git`
2. Make sure the glmnet package is downloaded and the folder in added in the MATLAB path.

### Model testing and performance

The MOBILE simulation of RPPA-RNAseq inference takes around XXX min for each of FULL or LOGO runs, in a normal desktop/laptop. 

The MOBILE simulation of RPPA-RNAseq inference takes around XXX min for each of FULL or LOGO runs, in a normal desktop/laptop. These simulations are run on Clemson University Palmetto HPC and took around XXX hours for each condition (XXX source info). 

Tested environments include: 
    - Ubuntu 18.04, Intel Core i7 3930 CPU @ 3.20 GHz, 32 GB DDR3, Nvidia GTX 690 GPU
    - Windows 10 Education, Intel Core i5-3470 CPU @ 3.20 GHz, 8.00 GB RAM, Nvidia GTX 650 GPU, 64-bit operating system
